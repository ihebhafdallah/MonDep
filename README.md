<ol dir="auto">
<li>To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.</li>
<li>Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the mondep.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.</li>
<li>Upload all files on your server except for mondep.sql.</li>
<li>The admin user which I have made has an email id <a href="mailto:admin@admin.com">admin@admin.com</a> and the password is <strong>admin</strong>. (Please confirm this in db or create one manually.</li>
<li>Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.</li>
